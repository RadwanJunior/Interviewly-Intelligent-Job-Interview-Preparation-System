      "delivery_analysis": "The candidate begins with a clear and steady pace. However, his tone shifts from professional to overly casual and unprofessional when discussing his motivation. Confidence is present, but it's misplaced in a statement that is a major red flag for recruiters. Enthusiasm is expressed only for financial gain, not for the role or company.",

          "Stating money as the primary motivator is highly unprofessional and demonstrates a lack of genuine interest in the company's mission or the technical challenges of the role.",

      "delivery_analysis": "The delivery is very casual, with filler words ('uh', 'I mean') that detract from professionalism. The tone is disengaged and lacks enthusiasm for the work being described. While the speech is clear, the content is so vague that it conveys very little information.",
