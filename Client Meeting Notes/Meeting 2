Jira Rundown
01/27/2025
Meeting minutes:30 min

Notes:
- Went through wiki to discuss architecutre 
- Explained epics at a high level and went thorugh building process
- Wrote some initial epics and user stories with stakeholder

Feedback:
- Convert modules section in wiki into epics 
- Focus on functionality to create user stories
- The smaller the user story the better. Allows to focus on trasks
- Approach by creating epics then think of user stories
- Try making user stories independant
- Usually working on epic together is better since u can present functionality quicker
